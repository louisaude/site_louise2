          <div class="hobby_text"> <center>SPORTS</center> <br>Growing up in the mountains, sports and winter sports have always been at the centre of my daily life. I have been competing in cross-country skiing for many years. I also run, surf, play tennis and practice alpine ski at different levels. <br>
            Sports give me the ability to test my limits, to challenge myself and brings me well-being.</div>

          <div class="hobby_text"><center>MUSIC & PERFORMING ARTS</center><br>I have been playing piano since the age of 6. Today, I still play, and try to expand my range of musical genres. <br>For 5 years, I was part of an amateur acting troupe composed of 20 art enthusiasts. We put together a show mixing music, dance and theatre, before going on tour with it. <br>           
            These experiences strongly developed my taste for teamwork and creativity.</div>

          <div class="hobby_text"> <center>VIDEO</center><br>While working in Cape Town,  I decided to make videos for the first time about my trip to send to my family and friends. And I discovered that I really liked it. <br>Three years later, I have the habit of taking out my phone to film and collect videos in order to edit them. <br>Today, I am eager to learn even more and to develop in this field.</div>

            Thanks to the many trips that I was lucky enough to be able to make with my parents, and my 6-month stay in South Africa, I understood how enriching it was to discover something else, both personally and for my professional choices. <br> I am convinced that we all have a lot to learn from each other.</div>
