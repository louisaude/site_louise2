        <center>The varied experiences and opportunities I was offered have given me an insight into the way teams work well together. I understood how crucial the ability to communicate, to federate, to set priorities, the ability to set clear common goals but also individual ones, and to leave some room for autonomy, are when managing a project.
These are some lessons I learned about work and about myself, that are in no small part responsible for me applying to your company today: </center>
