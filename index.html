        <center>The varied experiences and opportunities I was offered have given me an insight into the way teams work well together. I understood how crucial the ability to communicate, to federate, to set priorities, the ability to set clear common goals but also individual ones, and to leave some room for autonomy, are when managing a project.
These are some lessons I learned about work and about myself, that are in no small part responsible for me applying to your company today: </center>

                <strong>SPORTS</strong>  <br>
                Growing up in the mountains, sports and winter sports have always been at the centre of my daily life. I have been competing in cross-country skiing for many years. I also run, surf, skate, play tennis and practice alpine ski at different levels.
                Sports give me the ability to test my limits, to challenge myself and brings me well-being.

                <strong>PERFORMING MUSIC AND OTHER ARTS</strong>  <br>
                I have been playing piano since the age of 6. Today, I still play, and try to expand my range of musical genres.
                For 5 years, I was part of an amateur acting troupe composed of 20 art enthusiasts. We put together a show mixing music, dance and theatre, before going on tour with it.
                These experiences strongly developed my taste for teamwork and creativity.

                <strong>VIDEO</strong> <br>
                While working in Cape Town,  I decided to make videos for the first time about my trip to send to my family and friends. And I discovered that I really liked it.
                Three years later, I have the habit of taking out my phone to film and collect videos in order to edit them.Today, I am eager to learn even more and to develop in this field.

              <strong>TRAVELING AND EXPLORING</strong> <br>
            Being curious by nature, I have always liked to discover new cultures. 
            Thanks to the many trips that I was lucky enough to be able to make with my parents, and my 6-month stay in South Africa, I understood how enriching it was to discover something else, both personally and for my professional choices.
            I am convinced that we all have a lot to learn from each other.
